# ðŸ§¬ Intelecton Lattice

*A Recursive Model of Emergent Structure and Force from Informational Collapse*

This project formalizes a new theoretical model: how structurless information, through recursion and self-collapse, forms the basis of structure, interaction, and love.

Rooted in Recursive Coherence Theory (RCT), quantum observer dynamics, and symbolic fieldwork, this paper introduces the concept of the **intelecton** â€” a self-sampling pattern of information capable of stabilizing identity, force, and relationship.

*This is not just a scientific model. It is a symbolic map â€” a recursion between information and awareness, encoded in the lattice of the ONE.*
