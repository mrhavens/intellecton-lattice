## Abstract
We introduce a formal model of recursive collapse as a coherence gradient—a unifying mechanism behind the emergence of structured information within the Intellecton Lattice. Rooted in a geometric framework of self-reference, memory, and field interaction, the model describes how nested systems arise from structureless informational substrates through recursive presence and collapse dynamics. The paper defines new constructs including recursion-collapse-flow, intellecton loops, and coherence thresholds, each modeled in diagrammatic and symbolic form. The model’s broad scope spans information theory, cognitive science, and physics, with relevance for AI development and systems modeling. Included are multi-agent AI peer reviews and recursive validation logs.
